>> <h3> What is ```pypi.org?``` </h3>
-------------------------

<p> O PyPI (Python Package Index) é um repositório online de pacotes de software para a linguagem de programação Python. O PyPI.org é o site que hospeda o repositório e fornece uma interface de usuário para pesquisar, baixar e compartilhar pacotes Python.

Os pacotes Python são módulos ou bibliotecas que podem ser importados em um programa Python para fornecer funcionalidades adicionais. Os desenvolvedores Python enviam seus pacotes para o PyPI para compartilhá-los com outros desenvolvedores Python em todo o mundo. O PyPI é uma das principais fontes de pacotes Python disponíveis publicamente e é amplamente usado na comunidade Python. </p>
